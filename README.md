lwrf-graph
==========

Lightwave RF (https://www.lightwaverf.co.uk/) energy graphing tool

This a quick hacked up script that I wrote in an evening.

lwrf-cron.php - Uses the public url for the lwrf data to gather daily usage and populate a mysql db

lwrf.php - uses google graph api to chart it

lwrf-index.php - Simple index page with different report options
